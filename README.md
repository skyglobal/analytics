Analytics
=========
BSkyB wrapper for Adobe Sitecat analytics JS.

## Using Analytics
### JS
"//analytics.global.sky.com/version-number/analytics.js"

## Building Analytics Locally

### Code structure
- lib/analytics.js
  minified js containing the /source js files

- lib/analytics.js.map
  source map useful for debugging

- views/
  Documentation for using the API

- app.rb
  A basic Sinatra server for displaying the documentation, and running the tests

- test/
  the functional tests for the API

- circle.yml
  Configuration for the CI server

- config.ru
  Configuration for running the Sinatra server

- Gruntfile.js
  Configuration for grunt tasks - to do with compiling the javascript

### Prerequisites

- RVM
- Ruby (version 1.9.3 or later)
- npm

### Setup
1. Clone the repository from Github onto your local machine
2. Install npm
  - echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  - . ~/.bashrc
  - mkdir /usr/local
  - mkdir ~/node-latest-install
  - cd ~/node-latest-install
  - curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1
  - ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  - make install # ok, fine, this step probably takes more than 30 seconds...
  - curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
3. Install the project dependencies
  - npm install

### Running

1. In the root of the project, run the following:
  - bundle
  - jekyll serve
2. In another terminal run 'grunt watch' (add ' --beautify' to help debugging)
3. You should be able to see the documentation site in your browser on http://localhost:4000

### Testing
Tests are found in the test directory. At present only functional
tests are run. These tests use minitest and capybara.

To run the test suite, simply type `rake functional` in your terminal

You can add additional files within the functional directory and these will be
picked up by the rake task.

The tests within the functional directory will be run on the CI server
automatically upon pushing to Github

### Deployment
In order to release a new version of the library, the version number in _config.yml must be
incremented following the rules below: 

#### Versioning
This library should follow the [Semantic versioning
specification](http://semver.org/). In short, that means the following:

Version: X.Y.Z

- API changes that are **not backwards compatible**, and break existing
  calls using the API must increment the X value.

- API changes that introduce **new backwards compatible changes**, or **change the
  internals**, but not the interface, of existing methods will increment the
  Y value.

- **Patches or bug fixes** that are backwards compatible should increment the
  Z value.


Upon commiting and pushing your code to Github, the CI server will run through
the functional tests and - if there are no errors - a new version of the library
will be deployed to the CDN using the version number specified in the
_config.yml file.
